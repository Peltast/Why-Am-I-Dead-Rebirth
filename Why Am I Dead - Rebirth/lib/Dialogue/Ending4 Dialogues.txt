Lucille:"You came here to meet with the hotel owner, didn't you?  To talk about...business."
Cricket:"That's right.  But someone interfered with that by killing him.  I decided to find out who it was...and I suppose I did."
Randy:"Someone feel like explaining things here to me?"
Lucille:"..."
Lucille:"The truth is, I've been investigating this hotel almost since I first got here."
Lucille:"The owner found out, and I was forced to kill him in self defense."

Randy:"I never knew about this.  I never could have guessed.  If I knew, I wouldn't have..."
Cricket:"Of course you didn't know.  Nobody ever thinks it can happen.  Not here.  Not where I live."
Cricket:"It's the banality of evil.  The truth is always peeking out around the corner, but you turn your head.  You don't really want to see."
Cricket:"When you worked here, did you really never question what you were doing?  Not once?"
Cricket:"And imagine all of the other tenants who must have noticed there was something wrong - where are they now?"

Lucille:"But I still had questions."
Lucille:"How many more places were out there like this one?  How many people like Cricket are out there?"
Lucille:"How did a place like this escape our attention for so long?  Am I the first to discover it?"
Lucille:"And was my mission that initially led me here a coincidence?  Or was there a deeper meaning to it all?"
Lucille:"These questions haunt me, but I know that I did everything I could."
